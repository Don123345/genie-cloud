          # TODO  Replace **ALL** occurrences of `${REPO_ROOT}` with the path 
          #       to this repository clone on your local file system.
          #       
          #       You can find the repository path by executing
          #       
          #           git rev-parse --show-toplevel
          #       
          #       in any directory of the clone.
          #       
          #       ### Example ###
          #       
          #       Given
          #       
          #           $ git rev-parse --show-toplevel
          #           /Users/nrser/src/github.com/stanford-oval/almond-cloud
          #       
          #       and an example line
          #       
          #           path: ${REPO_ROOT}/src
          #       
          #       the edited line would read:
          #       
          #           path: /Users/nrser/src/github.com/stanford-oval/almond-cloud/src
